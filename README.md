This is my VERY FIRST website. I have not sketched an outline, nor thought of what the end result is to be. This is getting my hands dirty so to speak. I want to see how this will change, how it will evolve, and furthermore what it will teach me about designing a website.
There is nobody helping with this website as of now and it is being created/added as I progress in my skills. Also, the content of this website is NOT intended for anything commercial, NOT to be politically charged, NOTHING ELSE but the sole purpose of this website and all of its contents are for personal educational purposes strictly. My opinions are my own. Period.
If you happen to like or appreciate, or have any constructive comments -- please feel free to leave them. Thank you!
