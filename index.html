      Here we go on this journey together -- with fear and doubt. The path to finding oneself is
      in the areas outside of our comfort zone. Have you ever been kicked down and looked down on for nothing
      more than being seen as inferior? Have you ever been told that you will never amount to anything? How about
      labeled as something you are not? You see, sometimes it isn't other people who are doing this to you. Sometimes,
      it's you.
    </p>
    <h2>You Will Overcome!</h2>
    <p>
      It is difficult to stay positive when all you have ever known is negativity. Do not let anybody define who you are as a person. Discover what you are made of by
      exploring things you've never explored. Take chances, make mistakes, and learn. This is how growth happens. It is scary at times and especially counter intuitive
      to what you are used to... but that's the point! Take one step... then another... fall... get back up... repeat the process!
